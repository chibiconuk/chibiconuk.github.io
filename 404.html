    Hermes: When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town
    with a foot and a half of water
    Everyone was alright, but I cried all night
    It blew my alphabet blocks out of order
    And they said this boyâ€™s born to be a bureaucrat
    Born to be all obsessive and snotty
    I made my friends and relations file long applications
    To get into my tenth birthday party.
    LaBarbara: But something changed when my man turned pro.
    Hermes: I was sorting but I wasn't smilin'
    LaBarbara: He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks
    Hermes: It's supposed to be about the filin'!
    People,
    We didn't choose to be bureaucrats
    No, that's what Almighty Jah made us
    We'd treat people like swine and make them stand in line
    Even if nobody paid us
    They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats
    They say we're anal, compulsive and weird
    But when push comes to shove you gotta do what you love
    Even if it's not a good idea
    Zoidberg!
    Zoidberg: They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon
    Farnsworth: They poo-pooed my electric frankfurter
    Leela: They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye
    Bender: I am Bender please insert girder
    Hermes: Everybody sing Jamaica!
    All: Jamaica!
    Hermes: Just the bureaucrats - Jamaica!
    Bureaucrats: Jamaica!
    Hermes: The grade nineteens!
    Morgan Proctor: ... Jamaica.
    Hermes: Sing me home,
    When push comes to shove you gotta do what you love
    Even if it's not a good idea!

    Bender: I am Bender baby, please insert liquor!
